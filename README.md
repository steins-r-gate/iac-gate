Secure & Cost-Aware IaC Gate is a small, practical pipeline that stops insecure or overpriced cloud changes before they’re deployed. Every pull request runs terraform plan (no apply), scans the plan with Checkov (misconfigurations) and Conftest/OPA (your own rules), and estimates monthly spend with Infracost. If a policy breaks—or a cost threshold is exceeded—the build fails with clear reasons. From day one this project uses Docker to keep everything consistent: containers run the tools and a Grafana + Prometheus + Pushgateway stack to chart violations, cost deltas, and pass/fail over time. It’s fast, reproducible, low-cost, and easy to demo to examiners or employers.
